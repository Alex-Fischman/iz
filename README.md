# iz: a programming language for me

## Examples

`a + b` == `(add a b)` == `{b a add}`

`(add (add 1 2) 3)` == `{3 {2 1 add} add}` == `{3 2 1 add add}`

## Goals
- Adaptable: I don't know what I'll want in the future. A language for me needs to support both type theory and custom allocators.
- Performant: iteration time and runtime are both important to me.
- Small: I prefer systems with minimal feature sets that can be extended.

## Compiler
- Thereâ€™s a consistent intermediate representation across all passes, which is a Tree
- A Tree has a slice of source text for errors, a list of children Trees, and arbitrary data
- The initial Tree has a 0..0 slice, one child leaf for each character, and no data
- The final Tree has a 0..0 slice, no children, and executable data
- Each compiler pass is a Tree mutator, which may return errors
- Each compiler pass should recur depth-first postorder

## Language
- Syntax: () + {} + [] + mixfix
	- Space separation like Forth and Lisp
- Semantics: stack based by default
	- () is reverse execution order
	- {} is forward execution order
- Userland
	- If statements, while loops, etc.
	- Operator overloading and definition
	- Find-and-replace hygienic macros
	- Namespaces
		- `use` imports any scope
		- All structs have a scope that contains their fields and methods
		- Struct scopes can be used for faking inheritance with composition

## Todo
Formalize the idea of contexts and scopes and passes
