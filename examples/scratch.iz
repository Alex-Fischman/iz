# stack should just be 5 here

# here are some examples of stack memory management
13 # a bare literal pushes its value
(copy 0) # copy uses the nth-from-top element
(move 2) # move moves the stack pointer
# both move and copy can take negative arguments

0 # 5 0

(copy 0) # dup
(move 1) # drop
(copy 1 move 3 copy -2 copy -2) # swap

# 0 5
